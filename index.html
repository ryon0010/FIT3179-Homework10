        <p>
          Household incomes in Malaysia vary significantly across different states. 
          In bustling cities like Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, higher incomes reflect the opportunities of urban life, 
          with industries and services driving growth. Meanwhile, rural states like Kelantan and Perlis tell a different story,
          where traditional livelihoods and limited access to resources result in lower income levels. 
          In 2022, the average household income across Malaysia is 1,234,000.
